# My deep learning from scratch

## using numpy without relying on other librarise like pytorch!

### if using an ordinary network without choosing proper weight initialize values the network will learning nothing.

### when using weight decay, remember to set weight decay lambda a small value like 0.1. If weight decay lambda is something like0.9, the loss will decline but train accuracy and test accuracy won't increase!
